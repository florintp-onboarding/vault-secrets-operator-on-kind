### What is it : 

  This project `vault-secrets-operator-on-kind` creates a Kind Kubernetes Cluster (kind1) and configures Vault Secrets Operator to sync the secrets.
  Vault Secrets Operator with static and dynamic secrets hands-on 

### Prerequisites :

  - Having Kind installed and configured: [Kind Tool](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
  - Having HELM package manager installed: [HELM package manager](https://helm.sh/)
  - JQ utility: JQ Command-line JSON processor: [JQ](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)
  - A valid Vault license

### Guidance and articles followed :

   This repo is used as hands-on experience for using Vault Secrets Operator to sync Kubernetes secrets from different secret mounts.
   The repo is built following the guidance:

   - [Vault Secrets Operator on Kubernetes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/vault-secrets-operator)
   - [Vault Database Secrets Engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/db-credentials/database-secrets)
   - [Vault LDAP Secrets Engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/secrets-management/openldap)

### Usage :

  - Clone the repository : `git clone https://github.com/florintp-onboarding/vault-secrets-operator-on-kind.git`.
  - Change into its directory : `cd vault-secrets-operator-on-kind`.
  - Put your Vault enterprise license in a file named `vault_license.hclic` in the root directory of this project.
  - Choose the desired version TAG of Vault Enterprise according to GA from [Vault Docker Enterprise TAGS](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/vault-enterprise/tags)
  - Change the ownership of the setup.sh file `chmod u+rx setup.sh`
  - Execute the all in one script `bash setup.sh` and check the deployed PODs and the secrets created.
  - Possible output is attached below.


###  Clean up infrastructure (KIND)
````
chmod u+rx clean.sh
bash clean.sh
````

###  Scritps to monitor and observe the secrets and PODs state
- Initialize the VAULT_TOKEN variable
````
unset VAULT_TOKEN
export V_TOKEN=$(cat init-keys.json|jq -r '.root_token')
````

- Watching the PODs state changes and keep the history into state_pods.txt
````
while : ; do
  sleep 1
  kubectl get pods -A -o json  | jq -r '.items[] | select(.status.phase != "Running" or ([ .status.conditions[] | select(.type == "Ready" and .status == "False") ] | length ) == 1 ) | .metadata.namespace + "/" + .metadata.name + " " + .status.phase + " " + .metadata.creationTimestamp' |tee -a state_pods.txt
done
````

- Watching the KV-V2 secret sync in APP namespace
````
while : ; do
  a=$(kubectl get  secret/secretkv -n app --template={{.data.password}} | base64 -D) 
  printf '\n%s %s' "$(date)" $a ; sleep 1 
done
````

- Watching the LDAP static-secret sync in demo-ns namespace
````
a="" ; while : ; do
  sleep 2;printf '\r %s ' "." &&  c=$(kubectl get secret vso-db-demo -n demo-ns -o json | jq -r .data._raw | base64 -D |jq -r) ; b=$(echo "${c}"|jq -r '.last_vault_rotation')
  if [[ "a$a" ==  "a$b" ]] ; then
   printf '\r %s  ' ""
  else
     a=$b && echo $c || printf '\n{Password=%s\nChanged_at=%s\nlast_vault_rotation=%s\nTTL=%s}\n' "$(kubectl get secret vso-db-demo -n demo-ns -o json | jq -r .data._raw | base64 -D |jq -r '.password')" "$(date)" "${a}" "$(kubectl get secret vso-db-demo -n demo-ns -o json | jq -r .data._raw | base64 -D |jq -r '.ttl')"
  fi
done
````

- Get all the PODs
````
kubectl get pods -A
````

### Possible Ouptut :
